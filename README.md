# MRTK-Quest-Sample

Sample project for setting up with [MRTK-Quest](https://github.com/provencher/MRTK-Quest). Used only for educational purposes.

Some users seem to have issues with getting MRTK and the Oculus integration properly imported into their projects.
As such, I'll update this repository with the latest releases of MRTK, Oculus integration and MRTK-Quest, so that it can be used as a reference.

Note, this repository does not contain any example content in order to keep the footprint as small as possible.
Further, to make this easier for people who struggle with Git to download, the repository **does not** use submodules, symlinks or git lfs.

Be sure to check out the MRTK-Quest FAQ in the [Readme](https://github.com/provencher/MRTK-Quest/blob/master/README.md).

Current setup:
- [MRTK](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity) V2.3
- [Oculus Integration](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/oculus-integration-82022) v16
- [MRTK-Quest](https://github.com/provencher/MRTK-Quest/releases/tag/v0.6.2) V0.6.2

In order to add example content, download the following packages and add them to the project. Both packages are **required**.
